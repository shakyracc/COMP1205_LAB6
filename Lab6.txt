Functions
1. What does the following code print? Explain.
number = 50
def func(number):
print(number)
number = 2
print(number)
func(number)
print(number)

2. write a program that prompts the user for the radius and height of a
3-dimensional cone and then calculates and prints the surface area and
volume of the cone. The calculation of the surface area and the volume
will be done in functions, as will the gathering of the inputs.

Part I:
Your program for this part will function as follows:
(a) Print out a message indicating what the program does.
(b) Prompt the user for the radius (a non-negative float) in feet.
(c) Prompt the user for the height (a non-negative float) in feet.
(d) Print the radius and height, but rounded to 2 decimal digits.
(e) Print the surface area and volume, rounded to 2 decimal digits.
This version of the program will not check that the input is correct; if the
user types anything other than a non-negative float, it can crash.
Your program must define and invoke two functions:
cone_surface_area(r,h):returns the surface area of a cone of radius r and height h
cone_volume(r,h) : returns the volume of a cone of radius r and height h.

The formulas for finding these values are as follows:
surface area = pi * r * (r + sqrt(r^2 + h^2))
volume = pi * r^2 * h / 3

Import the math module and use math.pi and math.sqrt() in these calculations.

Part II:
Next, you will replace the input commands that you used to get the radius
and the height in the previous program with a function that encapsulates
the input processing to check for correct input. You will define two functions for this purpose.
is nneg float(s): checks if string s denotes a non-negative floating point
value (not in scientific notation). This function should return True if s
contains (at most) one decimal point and one or more digits (and nothing
else); and False otherwise. According to this definition an integer should
return True. (See below for some examples illustrating calls to this function.)
get nneg float(p): repeatedly prompts the user using p until the user inputs a non-negative floating point value, returning the non-negative float
that was input (as a float, not a string). This function should invoke the
previous function to check the input string before converting it to a float.
To clarify how these functions are to behave, the result of some example
calls follow:
>>> is_nneg_float("2.15")
True
>>> is_nneg_float("3.")
True
>>> is_nneg_float(".5")
True
>>> is_nneg_float("123")
True
>>> is_nneg_float("-12")
False
>>> is_nneg_float("1e10")
False
>>>
>>> get_nneg_float("Enter a non-negative float (NN.NN): ")
Enter a non-negative float (NN.NN): -3
Must be a float value; please try again.
Enter a non-negative float (NN.NN): 3e10
Must be a float value; please try again.
Enter a non-negative float (NN.NN): 2.1
2.1
>>> get_nneg_float("Float, please (NN.NN): ")
Float, please (NN.NN): 105
105.0
>>> get_nneg_float("And another in same form (NN.NN): ")
And another in same form (NN.NN): x10
Must be a float value; please try again.
And another in same form (NN.NN): .19876
0.19876

Replace the input commands in your first program will appropriate calls
to the second of these functions.
3. Write a function that takes three integers as its input and returns whether
a triangle with those side lengths is a right triangle or not. Hint: sort is
your friend.
